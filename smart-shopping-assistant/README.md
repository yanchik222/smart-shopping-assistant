# Smart Shopping Assistant

A Java program that finds a combination of grocery items whose total cost is closest to a user's budget.  
It also includes utility classes for working with song data and JSON parsing.

## Overview
- Reads grocery items and prices from a file.
- Uses a Subset Sum algorithm to find the optimal shopping list for a given budget.
- Demonstrates object-oriented programming, file I/O, and algorithmic problem solving.
- Includes a utility package (`portfolio.music`) for JSON and time formatting.

## Technologies
- Java
- File I/O and JSON parsing
- Algorithm design (Subset Sum)
- Object-Oriented Programming

## File Structure
- `src/portfolio/subsetsum/` — main logic for budget and shopping list
- `src/portfolio/music/` — utility classes for song/time handling
- `resources/` — sample inputs and outputs
- `input.csv` — example input file
